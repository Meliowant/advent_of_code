# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code
contest](https://adventofcode.com/). I was involved into this contest by
suggestion of @colinbarr .

This repo contains solutions made with Python, and I use this contest as a way
to organize all my development around TDD.
